Currently in progress in c++

no integral coordination between files as of yet, however, 

source:
 contains the following .cpp files and their makefiles. 

    data2ps.cpp
    is a class that takes characters, or any kind of cohesive data, and turns them into 
    bit pairs, necessary for Quaternary Phase Shift Keying.

    ps2data.cpp
    is a class that takes a series of bit pairs and turns them back into characters, or
    cohesive data.

    main.cpp
    currently is used to test the translation between the two. It works, by the way. ;)

txt:
 used for data to transmit, etc.

    data.txt
    contains the data to be translated from characters to bit pairs.
