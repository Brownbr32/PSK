Welcome to the  wonderful c++ QDPSK hub!

transmitter:
    holds the transmitter C++ files and a makefile. Outputs the transmitter binary
    to the C++ folder (cd .. from here.)

receiver:
    holds the receiver C++ files and a makefile. Outputs the receiver binary
    to the C++ folder (cd .. from here.)

readWav.cpp:
    I used this file to assist in the dissection of .wav files so I'd know how to 
    write out to one. I'm pretty proud of the result, if I do say so myself. ;)

standards.h
    holds macros that are used in both transmitter and receiver; that's why it's in a
    shared folder.
