Intro to Differential Phase-Shift Keying (DPSK)

There is only one wave being transmitted, and only one wave to pay attention to: the
data-embedded wave. The phase shift of the current data-embedded wave's period is
compared to the previous period, and the difference in phase shift between the two is 
keyed to specific associated values (0-3). Thus the base phase shift is differential in
that the current phase shift value is the difference between that in the current period
and that in the previous period. Perpetuation of errors is more common here, because an
error in detecting one period is more likely to affect an error in detecting the 
following period; the recursive nature of the keying may lead to recursive errors.
