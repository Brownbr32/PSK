the following global variables are found in ./csv/globals:

samples/cycle (nyquistSamples)

Transmitter.m
The Transmitter.m is currently only capable of reading integers between 0 and 3
in the data.csv and translating the data into a transmitable signal in signal.csv, 
using encode.m to encode the numbers in a CPSK. There is no error checking or 
handling, however, so the input must be verified by the user.

Receiver.m
The Receiver.m receives signal.csv file as its input, uses decodePeriod.m to decode
one period of the signal into its corresponding data value.

encode.m
is used by Transmitter.m.

decodePeriod.m
is used by Receiver.m

Intro to Cohesive Phase-Shift Keying (CPSK)

There is a commonly-known sine wave being transmitted, and there is also a data-
embedded sine wave being transmitted. The data-embedded wave's phase is compared to the
commonl-known sine wave, and the difference in phase shift between the two is keyed to
specific associated values (0-3). Thus the base phase shift is cohesive in that it is
compared to the same sine wave throughout the entire transmission. The perpetuation
of errors is less common here than in its counterpart, due to the fact that the current
phase shift value is only dependent upon current information.
