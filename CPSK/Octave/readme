the following global variables are found in ./csv/globals:
frequency (f)
samples/cycle (nyquistSamples)

Transmitter.m
The Transmitter.m is currently only capable of reading integers between 0 and 3
in the data.csv and translating the data into a transmitable signal in signal.csv, 
using encode.m to encode the numbers in a CPSK. There is no error checking or 
handling, however, so the input must be verified by the user.

Receiver.m
The Receiver.m receives signal.csv file as its input, uses decodePeriod.m to decode
one period of the signal into its corresponding data value.

encode.m
is used by Transmitter.m.

decodePeriod.m
is used by Receiver.m
